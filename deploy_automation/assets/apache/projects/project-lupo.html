            <p><b>Vegan T-Rexes</b> are generally lovely, silly beings. They ADORE
                    fresh vegetables and anything that’s 100% vegan and gluten-                
                    free. Their only handicap is their relatively short arms, which are
                    tiny in comparison to their enormous bodies. This sometimes               
                    results in a long struggle to pick up their favorite flowers or                
                    vegetables, which can make them a bit cranky, and believe us:                
                    you don’t want to be anywhere near a Vegan T-Rex (or its big,                
                    sharp teeth) when it’s cranky. Vegan T-Rexes also have a passion                
                    for space yoga, but their bodies make it very difficult for them to                
                    perform most positions. This is unfortunate, as engaging in                
                    regular space yoga sessions keeps Vegan T-Rexes calm and                
                    peaceful.</p>

                    <p><b>Pizza World</b> covered in the finest melted cheese the
                            universe has to offer. During winter you’ll see parmesan                           
                            snow, which covers the tips of the crusty pizza crust                            
                            mountains. You’ll also find tomato sauce rivers and lakes, as                            
                            well as an occasional chilli fountain; these emit an extremely                            
                            spicy sauce. Salami flowers, garlic stones, prosciutto trees,                            
                            and many other peculiar ingredients decorate the cheesy                            
                            ground. Be careful though, as Pizza World is a very warm                           
                            place; this can make the melted cheese dangerous if you                           
                            stand in the same spot for too long. The origin of Pizza                            
                            World remains a mystery, as the recipe for the whole planet                            
                            has been lost to time.</p>
